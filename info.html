        <h1>Assembloid Space by Jenn Leung, Chloe Loewith, and Ivar Frisch</h1>
        <p>
            Assembloid Space is a design and development studio exploring synthetic ecologies of brain, machine, and motion. Founded through a collaboration between creative technologist and neuroarchitecture researcher Jenn Leung, bioethics scholar Chloe Loewith, and speculative philosopher and AI researcher Ivar Frisch, the studio operates at the intersection of cognition, computation, and embodiment.

            The project was first incubated at the Antikythera Cognitive Infrastructures Studio (2024), part of the Berggruen Institute. The team has since published Organoid Array Computing: The Design Space of Organoid Intelligence in antikythera: journal for the philosophy of planetary computation. Read it here.
            
            Assembloid Space continues to develop systems for wetware computing, game engine simulations, and biological neural networks—advancing design at the edge of synthetic cognition and embodied computation.
