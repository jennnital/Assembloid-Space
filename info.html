        <h1>Assembloid Space by Jenn Leung, Chloe Loewith, and Ivar Frisch</h1>
        <p>
            Assembloid Space is a research and design agency exploring synthetic ecologies of brain, machine, and motion. 
            Founded by creative technologist and neuroarchitecture researcher Jenn Leung, bioethics scholar Chloe Loewith, and speculative philosopher and AI researcher Ivar Frisch, the studio operates at the intersection of cognition, computation, and embodiment.
            Incubated at the Antikythera Cognitive Infrastructures Studio (2024) at the Berggruen Institute, the team investigates emerging cognitive systems across biological and computational substrates. 
            Their work contributes to the expanding field of Organoid Intelligence (OI)—the interfacing of brain organoids with digital systems to explore novel forms of adaptive, embodied computation.

            In their publication, Organoid Array Computing: The Design Space of Organoid Intelligence (published in antikythera: journal for the philosophy of planetary computation), the team proposes a multiscale design framework for OI systems. Organoids—three-dimensional, stem-cell-derived neural structures—are recontextualized not just as biological components, but as active, evolving computational substrates. This work challenges the traditional software/hardware dichotomy in biocomputing by demonstrating how organoids move along a continuum between these categories through biochemical feedback and iterative interaction.

            Assembloid Space approaches OI not as a product of top-down engineering, but as a form of guided evolution, where higher-order cognitive capacities may emerge from the complex interplay of neural assemblies and interface design. 
            Their speculative practice emphasizes modularity, nested experimental design, and polycomputational logic, advancing the potential of biological neural networks as scalable, in vitro–to–in silico architectures.

            Through research, simulation, and embodied design practices, Assembloid Space continues to develop systems for wetware computing, game engine simulations, and experimental neural architectures—pushing the boundaries of synthetic cognition and planetary-scale computation.
